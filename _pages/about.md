I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Minnesota. My research focuses on building efficient, scalable, and adaptable systems to meet the increasing data demands of modern applications. Currently, my focus is on Distributed Machine Learning Systems, Serverless and Microservice-based Systems, and Quantum Computing Systems. My work has received recognition with four Best Paper awards and has been published in top venues such as USENIX ATC, FAST, EuroSys, VLDB, HPDC, SC, ICSE, and AAAI. I have also received multiple awards from IBM, and I am a co-inventor on more than 15 US patents. Additionally, I have received the Samsung GRO award and the Pratt Fellowship award from Virginia Tech.

Before joining UMN, I worked at IBM Research as a Research Staff Member in the AI Platforms team. In my earlier years, I gained invaluable experience working as a tools developer on several open-source projects (GNU GDB, Embedded Linux, U-Boot, and BusyBox) at Mentor Graphics.
