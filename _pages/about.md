I am an Assistant Professor in the [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://cse.umn.edu/cs "Computer Science and Engineering Department") at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/ "University of Minnesota"). I focus on designing scalable, high-performance, and user-friendly systems capable of efficiently managing and processing vast volumes of data. My research spans a diverse range of topics within systems, including distributed systems, machine learning systems, serverless and cloud computing, storage
systems, operating systems, high-performance computing, and quantum computing.

Currently, I am working on (1) **Systems for ML**, enhancing computing and storage systems to support distributed ML more effectively; (2) **Enhancing AI Safety**: crafting distributed modeling architectures to bolster the safety and reliability of ML systems; (3) **Federated Learning**: addressing the challenge of heterogeneity across the stack to optimize Federated Learning systems; (4) **Quantum Computing**: developing robust communication systems for quantum computing; (5) **Serverless and FaaS**: innovating serverless computing with an integrated approach encompassing the entire software-hardware spectrum.

My work has received recognition with five Best Paper awards. I have also received multiple awards from IBM, and I am a co-inventor on more than 15 US patents. Additionally, I have received the [Samsung GRO award](https://samsungmsl.com/ "Samsung GRO award") and the [Pratt Fellowship award](https://cs.vt.edu/Graduate/Funding/fellowships.html "Pratt Fellowship award"). I was ranked among the [Stanford's World's Top 2% Scientists](https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/7) in 2024. Before joining UMN, I worked at [IBM Research Almaden](https://research.ibm.com/labs/almaden "IBM Research Almaden") as a Research Staff Member in the [AI Platforms](https://research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence "AI Platforms") team. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/ "Virginia Tech"), working with Dr. [Ali R. Butt](https://website.cs.vt.edu/people/faculty/ali-butt.html "Ali R. Butt"). During my Ph.D. I spent three summers at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/ "IBM Research"). In my earlier years, I gained invaluable experience working as a tools developer on several open-source projects ([GNU GDB](https://sourceware.org/gdb/ "GNU GDB"), [Embedded Linux](https://www.yoctoproject.org/ "Embedded Linux"), [U-Boot](https://source.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot "U-Boot"), and [BusyBox](https://www.busybox.net/ "BusyBox")).
