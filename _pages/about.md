Hello! I'm an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Minnesota. My passion lies in the fascinating intersection of distributed systems and machine learning. My research is dedicated to developing systems that are efficient, adaptable, and capable of supporting the increasing data needs of modern applications, such as distributed machine learning. These applications must run seamlessly on both current and next-generation computing platforms. Presently, I'm channeling my efforts into Distributed Machine/Federated Learning systems, serverless and microservice-based systems, and exploring the realm of quantum computing systems.

I earned my doctorate in Computer Science from Virginia Tech. Before taking my role at the University of Minnesota, I was part of the IBM Research from 2018 to 2022. Before that, from 2009 to 2013, I gained invaluable experience working as a tools developer on several open-source projects at Mentor Graphics. These projects included GNU GDB, Embedded Linux, U-Boot, and BusyBox.

Over the years, I've been honored with several recognitions for my work. I received Best Paper awards at ACM AISec in 2019, DGS EGOV in 2020, and IEEE Cloud in 2022, all for my research on privacy-preserving Federated Learning. Additionally, I recently received the Best Paper award at ACM SYSTOR 2023 for my work on improving the efficiency of file serving in serverless computing.

IBM recognized my research on 'Advancing Adversarial Robustness in AI Models' with an Outstanding Research Accomplishment Award in 2019. In 2020, my research on Enterprise-Strength Federated Learning for Hybrid Cloud and Edge and Container Storage garnered two more Research Accomplishment Awards. In 2021, I was awarded an Outstanding Technical Achievement Award for my contributions to the same project. Beyond these, I am a co-inventor on more than 15 US patents.
