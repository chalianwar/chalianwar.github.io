I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. My research interests lie at the intersection of distributed systems and machine learning. The overarching goal of my research is to enable efficient and flexible systems for the growing data demands of modern applications, like distributed machine learning, running on existing and emerging computing platforms. My ongoing work focuses on (1) Distributed Machine/Federated Learning systems, (2) Serverless and microservice-based systems, and (3) Quantum computing systems.

I hold a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Virginia Tech (VT). Before joining UMN, I worked at IBM Research as a Research Staff Member (2018 to 2022). In my earlier years (2009 to 2013), I worked as a tools developer on various open-source projects (GNU GDB, Embedded Linux, U-Boot, and BusyBox) at Mentor Graphics.

I received Best Paper Awards from ACM AISec 2019 for my work on privacy-preserving Federated Learning, DGS EGOV 2020 on e-government implementations and applications, and IEEE Cloud 2022 again on privacy-preserving Federated Learning. I received a 2019 Outstanding Research Accomplishment Award at IBM for “Advancing Adversarial Robustness in AI Models.” In 2020, I received two Research Accomplishment Awards for my research on Enterprise-Strength Federated Learning for Hybrid Cloud and Edge and Container Storage. In 2021, I received Outstanding Technical Achievement Award for contributing to the “Enterprise-Strength Federated Learning for Hybrid Cloud and Edge.” I am also a co-inventor of 10+ US patents.
